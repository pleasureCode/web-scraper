# web-scraper
A new repository created via Python script

Here is the final code for a basic web scraper in Python using the BeautifulSoup library. This example scrapes data from a single page:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "http://example.com"  # replace with the URL you want to scrape
response = requests.get(url)

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
data = soup.find_all('div')  # replace 'div' with the HTML tag you want to scrape

for item in data:
    print(item.text)
```

Note: This is a very basic example, real-world web scraping can get complex depending on the structure of the website and the data you want to scrape. Also, make sure you are allowed to scrape the website you choose by checking its `robots.txt` file (i.e., `http://example.com/robots.txt`).
